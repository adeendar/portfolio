            <h2>Olneyville Neighborhood Association (ONA)</h2>
            <p>ONA is a Rhode Island-based community organization that provides a variety of different services, educational programming, and leads grassroots campaigns to protect their community in the heart of Providence.</p>
            <p>I decided to redesigned this website becuase I've heard about the organization on the local news and when I went to check out the website I noticed some design changes that could greatly improve the organization's image and branding.</p>

            </div>
      
            <p>My findings showed that the webpage has poor learnability since there are so many mouse clicks a user has to make before arriving to the actual services the website provides.</p>
            <p>I also found that the site that incorporate dual English/Spanish text can be confusing for users and does not display well across different screen sizes.</p>
